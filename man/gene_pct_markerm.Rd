\title{pct of cells in every cluster that express a series of genelists}
\usage{
gene_pct_markerm(matrix, marker_m, cluster_info, cluster_col = NULL,
  norm = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{expression matrix}

\item{marker_m}{matrixized markers}

\item{cluster_info}{data.frame or vector containing cluster assignments per cell.
Order must match column order in supplied matrix. If a data.frame
provide the cluster_col parameters.}

\item{cluster_col}{column in cluster_info with cluster number}

\item{norm}{whether and how the results are normalized}
}
\value{
matrix of numeric values, clusters from mat as row names, cell types from marker_m as column names
}
